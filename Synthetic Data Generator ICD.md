# Synthetic Data Generator  
# Interface Control Document

## Overview

Synthetic IRIG 106 data files are data files that contain data IRIG 106 format data
that is similar to actual recorded flight test test. Most actual flight test data has
restricted distribution and so isn't available for many developers. Synthetic data
solves this problem by providing data files that are very similar to what might be
expected from an actual flight data recorder recording an actual aircraft mission.

Normally an Interface Control Document (ICD) describes a single data file format.
It is anticipated, though, that synthetic data files may be similar to each other but
may be tailored to demonstrate particular data types or values.

A synthetic IRIG 106 data file is a complete and properly formed data file in 
compliance with IRIG 106. A synthetic data file will be of a particular **Data File Layout** as
described in the sections below. 

A particular synthetic data file contains one or more 
IRIG 106 data channels. Each synthetic data channel present is formed and formatted 
in one of the **Data Channel Layouts** defined below.

A synthetic data file will be formatted in accordance with a specific “IRIG File Layout” as defined 
in the following sections. For example, IRIG Data File Layout 1 defined below contains (or may contain) 
specific TMATS, Time, Video, PCM, and MIL-STD-1553 data channels. Each IRIG data channel, such as the 
MIL-STD-1553 channel, contains data of the specified type and formats as defined later in this document. 
In this way different IRIG File Layout definitions can be defined in a “mix and match” fashion from 
defined data channel types.

### IRIG 1553 Subaddress Data Layouts

Below are definitions of various 1553 messages. Each message layout section defines up to
32 16-bit words associated with one 1553 subaddress. For the purposes of this ICD 1553 bit

### ARINC-429 Message Data Layouts

The ARINC-429 data word format contains an 8 bit **Label** field. The Label field bit order is
reversed, with the most significant bit being right-most in the 32 bit 429 data word. Besides
being reversed, the value of the label field is often displayed in 3-bit octal notation. So
for example, an ARINC-429 Octal Label = 41 is 00 100 001 in binary. Reversing the bits this
label value is stored in the lable field as 1000 0100 in binary (or 0x84 in hex).

For all ARINC-429 Message Data Layout messages defined below **SDI** and **SSM** fields have the
following definition.

| SDI Code          | 10  | 9   |
